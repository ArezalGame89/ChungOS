# Contributing to ChungOS

Thanks for your attempt to contribute to this messy code-based operating terminal!

If you have any questions, **DO NOT** hesitate to [open up an issue](https://github.com/ArezalGame89/ChungOS/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=question.md&title=) or mail me at aradytfa@gmail.com!

## Rules and Guidelines

PRs and Issues will be checked here, first to see if it would be a great contribution, then check if it is *NOT* submitted improperly

### Issues
  - Making a useless issue, and then closing it for no reason.
  - Speaking non-english
    - Unless there are translator mods. This rule is yet to be *enforced*
  - Stupid features, and already added ones
    - No, unless announced, we cannot develop an online service
  - Harrasing others, not helping people's actual issues
  
### Pull Requests
  - The PR must be good, no comment changes or bloating.
  - Under no circumstances should you EVER threaten/beg people to review your code
  - Blindly linting, and artifically raising your line count is NOT tolerated
  - Insulting comments who perform great.
  - [Just don't. Get outta here if you're under 13](https://github.com/MR-FNF).
