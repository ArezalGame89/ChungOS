## What is this?
Python Script to stand as a terminal Operating system. But instead of being booted off your PC. It runs STRAIGHT on your Terminal/Command Prompt!

## How to use?

When you run ChungOS. You appear with something similar to this:
```
__main__>
```

To interact, run commands like 
```sh
mkdir <your-dir-name>
run-lua
run-luafile
cmd # ONLY FOR WINDOWS
bash # ONLY FOR LINUX
terminal # ONLY FOR MAC (DARWIN)
```

If you want to see all the commands, check `all_commands.txt`

3. type in `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install the required modules.

# Lua Support

Since ChungOS runs on [Lupa Runtime](https://pypi.org/project/lupa/). You're free to write anything you want!

   Make sure your Script ends in `.lua` and put it in `assets/preload/raw_scripts`
   
   Use `run-lua` to run all the scripts that are there.
