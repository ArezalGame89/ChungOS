### Do, `.` and `~`

#### DO
after typing this word,

Your Syntax depends...

- If you use windows. enter batch/cmd code

- If you use linux/mac. enter bash/zsh codes respectively
# Lua Support

You can use [Normal Lua](https://www.lua.org/) to Alter/Extend ChungOS's Functionality

Since ChungOS runs on [Lupa Runtime](https://pypi.org/project/lupa/). You're free to write anything you want!

#### `.`
After the period, Enter the program filename on files/Programs. They are Case-Sensitive and you do not need to type the extension

#### `~`
> This really is putting lua runtime into test isn't it? - MikeDeer0Gaming34, FCO of NUG

You can do one-line code (or make multi-line possible by `\n`s) lua by typing ~ as the first letter and your codebase next

###

## How to run?
   
   Make sure your Script ends in `.lua` and put it in `assets/preload/raw_scripts`
   
   Use `run-lua` to run all the scripts that are there. 
   
   Or use `run-luafile <yourfilename>` to run your specified .lua file!
